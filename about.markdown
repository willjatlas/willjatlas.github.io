# About

This site was made so that I could have a place to put my CV online, and it turned out to be an interesting learning experience. The page is hosted on GithubPages as a static web page. 

This site used the default minima theme that is provided with Jekyll, which I found very useful for getting a basic understanding of the code layout. I hope to build on this theme, creating some of my own layouts, adn eventually, an overall theme for the page. Thanks for visiting!

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
